# welcome to [my](https://shellfish.racing "shellfish.racing") github profile

my name is kieran, but other people call me kieran. i do several things:
- completing my bachelors in computer science at [texas tech university](https://ttu.edu/)
- create dumb hobby projects such as [this](https://github.com/kieroid/bad-dwm), [that](https://github.com/kieroid/bad-dmenu), [here](https://github.com/kieroid/bad-st), [there](https://github.com/kieroid/shellfish.racing), and much more.
- host my [dotfiles](https://github.com/kieroid/kieroid), including my configs for coreboot, grub, vim, and scripts.
- listen to music and do more boring stuff instead of doing my homework.

if there is anything you want to say to me, feel free to check out my website, or email me at [someone@example.com](mailto:mailto:someone@example.com). (this is a fake email so don't try emailing me.)
